		<h1>Dear Alex Tam,</h1>
		<p>Today was the day I was supposed to be visiting the University of Melbourne, cheering you on as you cross the stage and receive your diploma for completing your undergraduate career. Even though there isn’t a memorable graduation ceremony this year where we could unite and celebrate, I hope that at least you can keep this for the rest of your life.</p>

		<p>I am thankful that you showed up at Bowles Hall Residential College over a year ago. I remember the first day I met you. I was with Lorena in the dining hall. I met you and the three of us started talking while I watched you hastily shove food into your mouth before mumbling an apology for the brief conversation -- for you had a class to attend. That was the start of a friendship that would change my life for the better. As I said before, spending time with and getting to know you and Lorena made me so immensely happy. Looking back at college, I look fondly back at the memories we shared together for they will always be some of the highlights of my college career.</p>

		<p>I have so many great things to say about you. I don’t even know how to articulate it all to you. I happily remember all the memories-- from Berkeley to Hong Kong to Guilin and wonder what will be our next adventure. Our conversations have cheered me up, made me laugh, and released anger. I am able to be the weirdo I am with you. I learn a lot through our conversations about controversial topics. Thank you for putting up with all of my annoying rants. Thank you for caring for me when I was going through tough times. Thank you for taking care of my grandmother. Honestly, I’m jealous that you are the favorite grandchild. My friendship with you is valuable to me and will be something I always treasure.</p>

		<p>I hope you continue being you and working hard to achieve your dreams. As we both agreed on before, have dreams and reach for the moon and stars. Remember that you are enough and smarter than you think. That you are on your own path and you aren’t lesser than others. I believe in you and am excited to see all the amazing things you are doing and will do in the future -- and I hope you do too. While the future may be rooted in uncertainty, remember to be certain about who you are and what you are capable of as you continue learning and growing. Times can be tough, but remember that my family and I are always cheering for you somewhere across the world.</p>

		<p>Congratulations, Alex Tam. I hope you have a wonderful graduation day today. Hope to see you in Hong Kong and Macau soon :P </p>

		<p>Your friend,</p>
		<p>Debbie Yuen</p>
